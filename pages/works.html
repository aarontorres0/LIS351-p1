            <h4>The Lightning Network has a network of nodes all over the world that can route transactions through
                different channels. Anyone canconnect their Lightning wallet to a node they set up, or one that is
                provided by someone else. Lets say Adam wants to send 10,000 (0.0001 BTC) sats to Sam. They could open a
                channel directly between their nodes, or they could route it through different nodes on the network and
                pay a small fee to each Jack and Dan for instance who have a channel open between each other. </h4>
