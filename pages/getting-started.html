            <h2>How To Get Started</h2>
            <h4>There are many ways one can get started with the Lightning Network. With the <a
                    href="https://strike.me/en">Strike</a> app one can send
                payments to other users anywhere in the world, similar to Venmo or Cash app. Strike is also integrated
                with Twitter now so you can transact with anyone who has linked their Strike and Twitter accounts
                together. One can also use a Podcasting 2.0 app such as <a href="https://breez.technology/">Breez</a> to
                listen to their favorite podcasts and
                send sats to support their favorite creator, or just use it as an everday Lightning Wallet. These are
                custodial wallet options, but people can use non custodial wallets such as <a
                    href="https://zeusln.app/">Zeus</a> or <a href="https://zaphq.io/">Zap</a> for more privacy
                and security.</h4>
