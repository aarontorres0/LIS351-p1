                    <h2>How To Get Started</h2>
                    <h4>There are many ways one can get started with the Lightning Network. With the <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://strike.me/en">Strike</a> app one can send
                        payments to other users anywhere in the world, similar to Venmo or Cash app. Strike is also
                        integrated
                        with Twitter now so you can transact with anyone who has linked their Strike and Twitter
                        accounts
                        together. One can also use a Podcasting 2.0 app such as <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://breez.technology/">Breez</a> to
                        listen to their favorite podcasts and
                        send sats to support their favorite creator, or just use it as an everday Lightning Wallet.
                        These are
                        custodial wallet options, but people can use non custodial wallets such as <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://zeusln.app/">Zeus</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://zaphq.io/">Zap</a>
                        for more
                        privacy
                        and security.</h4>
